Description: Given a set of data points, a clustering is defined as a disjoint partition
    where each pair of sets in a partition has no overlapping elements. 
    This package provides 25 methods that play a role somewhat similar to 
    distance or metric that measures similarity of two clusterings - or partitions.
    For a more detailed description, see Meila, M. (2005) <doi:10.1145/1102351.1102424>.
